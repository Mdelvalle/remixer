# Remixer
### Using the [Echo Nest Remix] (http://echonest.github.io/remix/), mash your songs together to create a mix.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Still very pre-Alpha; I plan on adding some more features as soon as time lets me, such as:
######
- Smoother transitions from song to song
- Choose between a number of effects:
  * Slow/Speed up the BPM
  * Chop a specific range from a specific song

### Usage:
##### 'remixer.py [songs] [-dur]'
- **songs**: the songs you want to remix (must be in working directory).
- **dur**: the duration of the segment of each of the songs that will be in the the final mix.
